'''Small note here: An issue I was facing was the implementation of 
multiqubit gates, but since this is an attribute of pulse, 
it wouldn't make sense to have multiqubit systems attached to a single pulse. 
Therefore:   basically I will have a centralised entanglement manager,
which will entangle qubits and distribute it to whichever nodes need it
(forget about pulse here because entanglement based protocols do not exactly 
need optical fibres as opposed to P&M ones)..
this can be implemented independent to the state.py'''
